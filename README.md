Sinatra TextMate bundle
-----------------------

This TextMate bundle adds syntax highlighting and snippets for Sinatra.

It was inspired by [foca's sinatra-tmbundle](http://github.com/foca/sinatra-tmbundle) which seems
to have fallen somewhat out of date. This bundle contains an updated syntax and a lot more snippets.

**Enjoy :-)**
